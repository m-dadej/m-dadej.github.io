This example investigates the performance of R in comparison to Julia language. Additionally shows how to easily call Julia inside R code. With that being said, we will load `JuliaCall` library that enables us to do so. Alternatively, there is also `XRJulia` library available. 


{% highlight r %}
library(JuliaCall)
{% endhighlight %}

It is necessery to tell R where is Julia.exe stored, so the loaded library can communicate with it accordingly.




{% highlight r %}
julia_setup(JULIA_HOME = "path to the julia.exe")
# sometimes JuliaCall package requires to also set there a working directory 
# setwd("path to the folder with julia.exe")
{% endhighlight %}


Next we will define function that price [European options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_style#American_and_European_options) based on Monte Carlo simulation. Namely, simulates random path of prices many times for a given set of parameters and calculates value of option based on expected value of simulated payoffs. 

The model of motion of prices will be a following commonly used [stochastic differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion), called geometric Brownian motion:

$$dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t$$
Where $W_t$, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are respectively a [Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process), drift and volatility.

Price dynamics model as well as chosen derivative is not very complex. The point of herein document is to compare R and Julia performance on some well-known example. As show below, it is also easy to price such an option with the same price dynamics using a well known workhorse in finance, namely [Black-Scholes formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model#Black%E2%80%93Scholes_formula)



{% highlight r %}
MC_option_pricing <- function(K, S, r, mu, sig, t, n_sim, call_put){
  
  # defining function that generate geometric brownian motion
  rand_walk <- function(mu, sig, n_sim, r){ cumprod((rnorm(n_sim, mu, sig) + 1)/(r + 1)) }
  
  # initializing empty matrix
  simulations <- matrix(0, ncol = n_sim, nrow = t)
  
  # simulating random walk for a given number of times
  for (i in 1:n_sim) {  simulations[,i] <- rand_walk(mu, sig, t, r) }
  
  # different payoff for put and call option
  if (call_put == 0) { payoff <- simulations[t,] * K - S
    
  } else if (call_put == 1) {
    
    payoff <- S - simulations[t,] * K}
  
  # calculating expected value of option
  mean(pmax(payoff, 0))}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can check if the function is working properly. To do so, we will define Black-Scholes formula with a following equation for pricing call options:

$$ C(S_T, t) = N(d_1)S_t - N(d_2)PV(K)$$
$$d_1 = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{T} }\bigg[ln \bigg(\frac{S_t}{K}\bigg) + \bigg(r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \bigg)t \bigg]$$
$$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{t}$$
$$PV(K) = Ke^{-rt}$$
Where,

* $N(\cdot)$ is a C.D.F. of a standard normal distribution
* $S_t$ - Current price of underlying asset
* $K$ - Option strike price
* $t$ - time to option expiry
* $r$ - Interest rate of risk-free asset
* $\sigma$ - Returns volatility of underlying asset price


{% highlight r %}
BlackScholes <- function(K, S, r, sig, T, call_put){
  
  d1 <- (log(S/K) + (r + sig^2/2)*T) / (sig*sqrt(T))
  d2 <- d1 - sig*sqrt(T)
  
  if(call_put == 1){
    value <- S*pnorm(d1) - K*exp(-r*T)*pnorm(d2)
    return(value)}
  
  if(call_put == 0){
    value <-  (K*exp(-r*T)*pnorm(-d2) - S*pnorm(-d1))
    return(value)}}

S <- 40
K <- 50
mu <- 0
sig <- 0.03
T <- 100
r <- 0.001

BlackScholes(K, S, r, sig, T, 0); MC_option_pricing(K, S, r, mu, sig, T, 10e3, call_put = 0)

Prices are almost the same. The difference is insignificant and is only related to the number of simulations executed by `MC_option_pricing` function. Results from this function will converge to the result of analytical function as number of simulations increases. 

We will use `julia_command()` function to define very similar function but in Julia, which can be used in R.


{% highlight r %}
julia_command("
function MC_option_pricing(K, S, mu, r, sig, t, n_sim, call_put)
              
function rand_walk(mu, sig, t, r)
    dist = Normal(mu, sig)
    rets = rand(dist, t)
    rets = cumprod([x + 1 for x in rets] .* (1 + r)) 
    return rets
end

simulations = zeros(t, n_sim)

for i in 1:n_sim
  simulations[1:t, i] = rand_walk(mu, sig, t, r)
end

if call_put == 0
  payoff = simulations[t,:] .* K .- S
else
  payoff = S .- simulations[t,:] .* K
end

payoff[findall(payoff .<= 0)] .= 0
return mean(payoff)
end")
{% endhighlight %}

## MC_option_pricing (generic function with 1 method)
{% endhighlight %}
Alternatively, we can import whole script to R.


{% highlight r %}
#julia_source("path/monte_carlo_option_pricing.jl")
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we can define variables for both of the functions to compute. The most important will be the number of simulations that a particular function have to perform. This will ultimately determine how computationally expensive function will be.


{% highlight r %}
mu <- 0 # drift term
sig <- 0.02 # volatility (standard deviation)
t <- 100 # time to expiration
n_sim <- 10^6 # number of simulations
K <- 40 # strike price at expiration
S <- 60 # stock price at time tt = 0
call_put <- 0 # 1 for call option, 0 for put
r <- 0.002 # daily risk free rate 
{% endhighlight %}

Script for Julia have dependency, so we should also load a `Distributions` library.


{% highlight r %}
julia_library("Distributions")
{% endhighlight %}

Now we will use both functions to price put option based on 1000000 simulations, each with 100 rows/observations.

Note that Julia is sensitive to object types and sometimes need to have objects specified in explicit way. (use of as.integer() function).




{% highlight r %}
r_time <- system.time( r_price <- MC_option_pricing(K, S, mu, r, sig, t, n_sim, call_put = 1) )

julia_time <- system.time(julia_price <- julia_call("MC_option_pricing", K, S, mu, r, sig, as.integer(t), as.integer(n_sim), 1)  )
{% endhighlight %}

As before, Monte Carlo method have stochastic properities so the price vary a little. That is why, in order to obtain very precise value, it is neccessery to execute many simulations. According to R the price is 12 and Julia said it costs 12.002, a difference of 0.002. 

The computation took 20.37 seconds for R and 6.44 seconds for Julia, a difference of 13.93 seconds. Julia was 3.163 times faster.

It might be also interesting how long it takes to execute these functions many times but with fewer simulations. Package `microbenchmark` enables to do it easily.


{% highlight r %}
library(microbenchmark)
set.seed(123)

test <- microbenchmark(R = MC_option_pricing(K, S, mu, r, sig, t, 10^5, call_put = 1),
               Julia = julia_call("MC_option_pricing", K, S, mu, r, sig, as.integer(t), as.integer(10^5), 1))

summary(test)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##    expr       min        lq     mean    median        uq      max neval
## 1     R 1622.7621 1756.2746 1960.795 1846.8253 2090.7544 2775.161   100
## 2 Julia  539.4991  647.4372  740.886  682.4715  735.9604 1866.203   100
{% endhighlight %}

As we see in the summary, Julia function is on average 2.647 faster than R (by a median it's x 2.706). Over 100 repeats, none of R executions was faster than the slowest one of Julia.
