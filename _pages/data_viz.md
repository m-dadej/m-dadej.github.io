Here are some of the data visualizations i made. I have done them in R with ggplot2 library. These are my favourite tools for data viz. If you want a code feel free to contact me, as i usually dont keep them on my github.

You may find more charts on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/mateusz_dadej).

I keep them here for my own purpose, as a sort of library.

The one above should resemble Joy Division album cover. There is also an interesting anegdote about it - some random guy apparently made himself a t-shirt with it and send a picture of it to me :)
