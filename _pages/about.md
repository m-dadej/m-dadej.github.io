I am a Phd candidate in Analytics for Economics and Management at University of Brescia. I obtained my Masters degree in Economics at University of Gda≈Ñsk, during which I had an academic exchange at University of Pisa. Before starting Phd I was a quant analyst in an investment bank, where I was developing stress testing models. I authored a few scientific publications in computational economics and empirical finance. I am a member of Association of Polish Economists. 

My research centers around applying data science tools in domain of finance and macroeconomics however, my projects sometimes go beyond these fields. I am an R programming language aficionado, especially tidyverse packages and visualization with ggplot2, but depending on needs I use also Python and Julia languages. 

This is my personal website where you may find information about me and my projects or publications. I also very occasionally write random posts about things I consider interesting or feel like elaborating in more than few sentences. 

Have a look at my other accounts and social media, I am especially active on twitter.
