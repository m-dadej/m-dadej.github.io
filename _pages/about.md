I am an economist at Coface, covering the Central and Eastern European region. I have finished PhD studies at [University of Brescia](https://www.unibs.it/en) with research focused on quantitave methods for macro-financial stability. During my doctoral studies I was also a visiting researcher at [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/). I obtained my Masters degree in Economics at the [University of Gdańsk](https://ug.edu.pl/), during which I had an academic exchange at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english). Before starting Phd I was a quant analyst in an investment bank, where I was developing stress testing models. I authored a few papers in computational economics and empirical finance. I am a member of the [Association of Polish Economists](https://tep.org.pl/). I frequently provide my economic expertise [in media](https://m-dadej.github.io/in_media/).

My interest centers around the nexus of finance and macroeconomics. I am also interested in applied quantitative methods in economics. 

My first name is pronounced as Muh-TEH-woosh ({{IPA3|maˈtɛ<sup>w</sup>uʃ}}).
