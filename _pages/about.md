I am a Phd candidate in Analytics for Economics and Management at the University of Brescia. Currently staying as a visiting scholar at the University of Mannheim. I obtained my Masters degree in Economics at the University of Gda≈Ñsk, during which I had an academic exchange at the University of Pisa. Before starting Phd I was a quant analyst in an investment bank, where I was developing stress testing models. I authored a few papers in computational economics and empirical finance. I am a member of Association of Polish Economists. 

My research centers around the nexus of finance and macroeconomics. I am also interested in applied quantitative methods in economics. 

My first name is pronounced as Muh-TEH-oosh
