Software
======

* [MarSwitching.jl](https://github.com/m-dadej/MarSwitching.jl) - Julia package for Markov switching models (also called Regime-switching models). Listed in general registry of Julia packages (equivalent of R's CRAN and Python's pip).

* [stooq.pl wrapper](https://github.com/m-dadej/Downloading-and-aggregating-stocks) - A repository with functions for seamless download of market data from stooq.pl. Mostly useful for polish stock market data, given its low coverage by foreign sources (e.g. Yahoo finance from Pyhton's yfinance).
